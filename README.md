# CoffeeScript Bot
A bot I made with coffeescript, the worst, ugliest language ever.  
The bot does not work, it in fact is broken.

---
You shouldn't self-host a broken bot but here it is if you still feel like doing it:
```sh
# install dependencies
npm i

# compile the coffee, run eslint, then start the bot for a free error
npm start
```
